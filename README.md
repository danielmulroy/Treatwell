Drawing a square

Does what it says on the tin.

2 versions to choose from: one basic, one advanced.

Basic:
  Simple user input of width and height, outputs the rectangle/square.

Advanced:
  User must input correct values, or is prompted to try again.
  *Shouldn't* crash or throw exceptions. (emphasis on shouldn't)
  Also user given option to draw another rectangle/square after in a basic menu/UI.
